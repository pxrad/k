                            I'm designing 2 application using canva and 1 application using figma to understanding the flow of application was I made. My Project:
                            <p>- Dar's Shop</p>
                            <p>- Daily Kitchen</p>

                            <p>- Supply Chain Agriculture National (SCAN)</p>
                            <p>- Reach Your Network (RYN)</p>
                            <p>- PerfecX Baguette & Rad's Eatery</p>
                            <p>Creating a prototype of "KFav!" using Figma. "KFav!" is a application for watching Korean dramas. It's use simple things and just 4 menu to give easier to new user and fast understanding when using this application. This application was also free for Korean drama 2 years ago (ex. Korean drama out in 2019, it's was free to watch from 2021). Actually, this application was not clearly because I'm still design the logo and will be showed in the beginning of August, 2023. 
and also I'm on going to make an app about supply chain management for agriculture that can be giving information real-time about stock, storage, late, etc that giving impact for supply chain. The name of application is SCAN (Supply Chain Agriculuture National). SCAN can help customer to looking stock product of agriculture and also this application was so easy to use for beginner.
For the next project, I have a plan to design an application for education and social media named RYN.</p>
